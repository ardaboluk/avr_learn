In page 199, a technique is given about a voltage divider circuit for obtaining
discrete voltage levels. The paragrap below needs explanation:

"If you only need to produce four discrete voltage levels, you can connect both the high end and low
end of a resistive voltage divider to two AVR output pins. When both are driven high, the output will
be  VCC . When both are driven low, the output will read 0 V. When only one of the two outputs is
driven high, the output of the voltage divider will be between the two extremes."

I think that the schematic for the mentioned voltage divider would be like the one in voltageDivider.png.
The corresponding diagram including Atmega168 would be like the one in voltageDivider_fritzing.png.

Superposition principle is used to analyze this circuit. The output voltage in this case is calculated as
Vo = V1 * (R2 / (R1+R2)) + V2 * (R1 / (R1 + R2)).
